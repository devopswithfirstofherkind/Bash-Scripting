# Bash-Scripting
This is a repo of my Bash Scripts as I get better.

# **DAY 1**

For **day 1**, I write a script that outputs the following:

1. The hostname using the inbuilt `hostname` command.
2. The Uptime using the `uptime` command.
3. The Memory space on my linux machine using the `free -m` command
4. The disk space using the `df -h` command
5. The top 5 processes using a combination of `top`, and `head` commands.
