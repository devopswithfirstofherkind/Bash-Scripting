# Bash-Scripting
This is a repo of my Bash Scripts as I get better.

# **DAY 1**

For **day 1**, I write a script that outputs the following:

1. The hostname using the inbuilt `hostname` command.
2. The Uptime using the `uptime` command.
3. The Memory space on my linux machine using the `free -m` command
4. The disk space using the `df -h` command
5. The top 5 processes using a combination of `top`, and `head` commands.


# **DAY 2**
I skipped this day but this is just me making up for it.
For this day, the goal was to check if a user exits usinf an `if` statement and if not, user gets added.
Commands used were:
1. `id` - used to check if a user exits.
2. `if` statements - for conditions where the user exists or not.
3. `Read` - to collect output of the user name as a variable.
4. `$?` - This shows the success of a previous command.
